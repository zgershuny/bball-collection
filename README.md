Items Completed 
  1. collection page - renders all cards in the collection
  2. sales page - total sales in the collection
  3. homes page
  4. search page

Challenges
  1. UX - user experience design for search page- maybe combine it with the collection page

Next Steps
  1. implement a feature to update the card
  2. implement a feature to show the card's details
  3. implement a feature to update the sale
  4. implement a feature to delete the card
  5. determine what to do with the search page (as noted in the challenge section)

Week 3 - Due 5/4/2021
Items Completed
  1. Render a page that shows the card's details
  2. Render all the sales in the collection
  3. Update the sale for the individual card
  4. Delete the card
  5. Determined that the search page functionality is almost identical to add a new card. 
      Perhaps a same form can be designed with a button for the user to select to add or search

Challenges
  1. Cannot use one SQL query to update all card's details (as in updating multiple tables as once). 
      Will need to implement multiple queries
  2. Formatting is inconsistent on the card's details page. Will fix this at the end to beautify all pages

Next Steps
  1. Add a new card and its relevant information (and start working on search functionality here)
  2. Continue to work on updating the card's details
  3. Implement a feature to render slabs only or no slabs (collection/sales page)
  4. Implement a feature to render only sold and unsold cards (collection/sales page)
